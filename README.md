## December 2024 Update

Here is the latest run against the National Pokédex that brings the total number of Pokémon up to 1,025 from the 1,010 that had been discovered by the February 2023 release of of *Pokémon Scarlet* and *Pokémon  Violet*. It includes stat changes for Zoroark (571) and Kleavor (900) as well as 15 new Pokémon through Pecharunt (1025). 

The data source for the updated statistics is [pokemondb.net](https://pokemondb.net) and its generation by generation stats pages.

## March 2023 Update

With the February 2023 update of *Pokémon Scarlet* and *Pokémon  Violet* Pokémon national Pokédex numbers changed relative to the numbers assigned in the November 2022 release. Stats changes were applied to gen04, gen08 Pokémon.  The data files (zip, xlsx, and csv) now reflect the February updates. 


## November 2022 Update

With the release of *Pokémon Scarlet* and *Pokémon  Violet* Pokemon 906 through 1010 have been added to the Pokédex. These Pokémon are included in the gen09.csv file, as well as the full Pokémon.csv and Pokémon.xlsx files. Paldean forms of Taurus and Wooper are also included in the gen09.csv file. 

## July 2022 Update

With the release of *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*, Pokémon 899 through 905 have been added to the Pokédex. These Pokémon are included in the gen08.csv file, as well as the full Pokémon.csv and Pokémon.xlsx files. Galarian and Hisuian forms of older generation Pokémon are also included in the gen08.csv file. 

## December 2021 Update

As of December 14, 2021, no Pokémon have been added to the Pokédex beyond #898, Calyrex. If the January 28, 2022 release of *Pokémon Legends Arceus* contains additions to the National Pokédex, we'll update this repository to include the new Pokémon. 

## November 2020 Update

As of November 21, 2020, the data files have been updated to include Pokémon through Generation #898, Calyrex (including its Rider forms). Also included are stat updates to 26 Pokémon that were made as of Generation 7, courtesy of [ItsASine](https://github.com/ItsASine). We also cleaned the ASCII character mangling for male & female forms of Nidoran by replacing them with the words Male and Female, as is the standard in newer generations of Pokémon. 

Finally, we split the Form / Forme / Region / Gender modifiers from Pokémon names, saving them to a column named Form. 

As of July 4, 2018, the data files have been updated to include all seven generations of Pokémon through #807, [Zeraora](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/zeraora).
